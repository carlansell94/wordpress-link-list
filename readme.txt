A block to display a list of links, with custom titles, descriptions and icons.

== Description ==

A block-based WordPress plugin to add a list of links to a post/page.

Adds a new block named 'Link List', which can be inserted anywhere in a page.

In the block editor, new links can be added to the list. Each link has an icon, title and description. It's possible to add either an internal link (by searching for a post/page), or manually typing an external link. This field uses the same WP component as the built-in 'add link' button.

An option is available to either alternate the position of the icon and title/description on the front end, or show them inline. By default, the alternating option is used. This can be toggled in the editor sidebar.
