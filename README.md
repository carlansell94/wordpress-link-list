A block-based WordPress plugin to add a list of links to a post/page.

Adds a new block named 'Link List', which can be inserted anywhere in a page.

In the block editor, new links can be added to the list. Each link has an icon, title and description. It's possible to add either an internal link (by searching for a post/page), or manually typing an external link. This field uses the same WP component as the built-in 'add link' button.

An option is available to either alternate the position of the icon and title/description on the front end, or show them inline. By default, the alternating option is used. This can be toggled in the editor sidebar.

An icon is not required, though at present, the front end will leave a space where the icon would normally be shown.

Note that this is still in active development, and therefore the current feature-set is limited.

# How To Use
Download the .zip file from releases, and install it through the WordPress 'Upload Plugin' feature. If you want to clone the repository, you'll need to build the extension before it will run.

The release tagged 'latest' is considered the current version, with a second release (labelled pre-release) reflecting the latest state of the repository. Builds are automated on each commit.

# Future Development
The following features are planned for future versions of the plugin:
* Add a default icon to use where one is not specified
* Option to remove the icon entirely
* Support for small displays
